After a 45 year hiatus I find myself with another ham license. I had picked up paragliding as a new hobby
and bought a radio for talking to the paragliding instructor. I asked him about the frequency they use,
145.555 MHz, and he mentioned that it pisses off the ham radio guys. Seeing as how I had a license when I was 15 
(WN8RPT), I decided to take the test.

Now that I have a license, a few radios, and an SDR I've been looking for projects. So far, APRS and satellites have 
caught my eye. As of this edit, a TX igate is on the top of my projects list.
