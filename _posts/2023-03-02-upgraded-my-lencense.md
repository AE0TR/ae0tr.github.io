title: 'Upgraded My License From Technician to .... Amatuer Extra!'
---

Thanks to the good folks at The Villages Amatuer Radio Club, K4VRC. I participated in
their General Class License Class and while I was studying the General Class
License Manual I was also studying for the Amatuer Extra on hamstudy.org.

At the exam I got a better score on the Extra exam (90%) than I did on the
General exam (85%).

WN8RPT -> KE8HMV -> AE0TR
